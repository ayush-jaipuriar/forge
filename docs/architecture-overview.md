# Forge Architecture Overview

## Purpose

This document captures the Phase 1 architectural baseline that implementation should follow.

## Current Foundation

- React + Vite + TypeScript
- MUI-based custom theme layer
- Zustand reserved for UI and app state
- TanStack Query reserved for async and cache state
- Browser-router-based shell with feature route slices
- Query client and Firebase config boundaries created up front
- PWA plugin wired with a baseline manifest

## Layer Boundaries

### Presentation

- route shell
- feature pages
- reusable layout and status components

### Application

- use-case orchestration
- state composition between repositories and UI

### Domain

- routine generation
- scoring
- recommendations
- readiness logic

### Data

- Firestore repositories
- local cache and sync queue adapters
- seed loaders

## Immediate Milestone 0 Notes

- The starter demo app has been replaced with a route-based shell.
- The theme now reflects Forge's dark, disciplined product direction.
- Path aliases, Vitest, and a baseline PWA config are in place.
- Firebase is represented by config boundaries now and will be wired for real flows in Milestone 2.
